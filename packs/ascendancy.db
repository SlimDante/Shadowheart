If a player ascends after those levels, they add the extra AP to their initial AP.

The DM can also award ascension points as rewards for roleplay or even as quest rewards.</p>\n<p>When a player spends AP, they lose the points spent.

These summons are not the original creature, but copies of the creature, a living manifestation of your soul given form. They function the same way the original creature would, however when they die they vanish, leaving no corpse behind.</p>\n<p>What you can summon is determined by several factors. You can only summon creatures with an Intelligence score of 4 or less, the creatures cannot have legendary or lair actions, they must have a CR that is equal to or less than 1/3 of your character level, they must be a creature you have interacted with in the past, the creatures must be Medium or smaller in size, and they cannot be an undead or construct.</p>\n<p>You can summon up to three of these creatures as an action and they take their turn immediately before or after you in initiative, and they appear in unoccupied spaces within 10 feet of you. You can command your summons as a free action, the creatures regard you and your companions as friendly. The creatures summoned can hold their forms for 1 minute, after which they vanish. They will also vanish if you are knocked unconscious or die. </p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"SA:AS 10","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":1,"units":"minute"},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"You do not have the Soulbound Companion trait","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"CVptjiALjBpsCb5O":3},"flags":{"magicitems":{"enabled":false,"equipped":false,"attuned":false,"charges":"0","chargeType":"c1","destroy":false,"destroyFlavorText":"reaches 0 charges: it crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.","rechargeable":false,"recharge":"0","rechargeType":"t1","rechargeUnit":"r1","sorting":"l"},"core":{"sourceId":"Item.ssDVRIgpuUVienX0"}}}
